# Twitter Graph

This was an attempt to graph twitter followers. What I initially wanted was to be able to see a person's network and then be able to click on other followers to add their network as well. The amount of nodes would have been a little insane scaling very large so now I just have a backend that uses twitter api to get network and d3 graph of a persons graph. I used to graph mine just to see all my followers in one picture.
