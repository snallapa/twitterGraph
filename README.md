# Twitter Graph

This was an attempt to graph twitter followers. What I initially wanted was to be able to see a person's network and then be able to click on other followers to add to this network as well to be able to see who are on the outskirts of your network and maybe who you should follow. The amount of nodes would have been a little insane as it would be scaling very large as some people have a lot of followers/following. All I have right now is a backend that can get one persons network and a frontend that displays it using react and d3. I used it to graph my network just to see all my followers in one picture and it was already janky even though I follow 158 people.
